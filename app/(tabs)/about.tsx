Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// The file was missing a closing bracket for the createStyles function
const createStyles = (theme: any) => StyleSheet.create({
  // ... all style definitions ...
}); // Added closing bracket for StyleSheet.create
```

The file was only missing one closing bracket at the very end for the StyleSheet.create() call. All other brackets were properly matched. The fixed version includes this closing bracket which completes the createStyles function definition.
