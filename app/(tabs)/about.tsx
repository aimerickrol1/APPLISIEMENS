Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// The file was missing a closing bracket for the styles object
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  // ... all style definitions ...
}); // Added closing bracket for StyleSheet.create()

```

The file was only missing one closing bracket at the very end to close the StyleSheet.create() call. All other brackets were properly matched. The rest of the code remains unchanged.
